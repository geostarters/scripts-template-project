# Scripts Project Template

Templates to generate scripts in Node JS (typed with flow)

## <a name="types"></a>Using types
Using flow provides a way to check for common syntax errors while calling functions. Flow provides a simple example of which kind of problems it can solve in their [Type Annotations guide](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/). There's also a list of annotations it supports there.

## Folder structure

__scipts:__ Contains the built scripts, ready to use, generated by the "build" command in package.json (unflow).

__src:__ Contains the source files that compound the package.

__test:__ Contains the unit and integration tests

__flow-typed:__ Contains flow types definitions used i nthe project


## Prepare environment

````
npm install

````


## Working flow: STEPS

1.Create and develop your scripts in the **src** folder. 

1. Once you've finished run:

````
npm run build

````

3. The scripts (ready to execute), will be created in the **scripts** folder.

Example:

```
npm run run:example
```
